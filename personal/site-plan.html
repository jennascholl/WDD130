      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about the last time you took out a loan. Were you able to calculate in advance how much you were going to be giving in monthly payments? Did they break down for you how much of your payments were actually going toward your debt and how much was interest, or tell you how much in total you'd be paying in interest? Given some basic information, this website could help you understand the facts about your loan before you sign the papers by giving you the details in bite-sized chunks.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience for this website is made up of potential clients for the application described above: a tool that helps you break down the terms of your loan into pieces that are simple and easy to understand. These people are primarily young adults that are new to financial independence and are seeking extra help in order to understand all the working pieces of their current or potential loans.</p>  <!-- change this -->
