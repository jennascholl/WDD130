      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Our website contains an enormous archive of hundreds of recipes for you to explore; you’ll never get stuck cooking the same dinners over and over again if you use our service. By pushing a single button, you can generate a tasty random new recipe that includes ingredients, pictures, and easy-to-understand cooking instructions for a simplified night of cooking. The archive includes recipes from dozens of genres and cultures and includes something for everyone. If a recipe doesn’t fit your interests, no problem! Just generate a new one. Generate as many recipes as you need to find something that looks appetizing to you.

        Do you have a specific diet you’re trying to adhere to? Or are you just in the mood for something specific – maybe soup, or some kind of seafood. By using the optional filtering, you can find exactly what you’re looking for. You can limit your generator to virtually any popular diet, including vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, or gluten-free, among others. You can also generate by ingredient if you’re in the mood for something like chicken, shrimp, or even a really specific ingredient like Cajun seasoning. Whatever you’re feeling, we can give it to you. You can add as many or as few filters as you like. Just remember that the more filters you add, the more you’ll limit the variety of the generator.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the random generator’s not going to cut it and filtering’s just not enough, you can search for a specific recipe using the search page. Whether you forgot to Favorite a meal and need to find it again, or you need that one specific comfort food, you can put the title into the search bar and find it in our database. Once you find the recipe you’re looking for, you can Favorite it or add it to this week’s shopping list using the Meal-Planning feature.

Using the Favorites page, you can save your favorite recipes and make them again as many times as you want, whenever you want. Just click the heart icon on any recipe to archive it for later. When you navigate to the Favorites page, you will find a list of all your favorite recipes, including the title and a photo for easy recognition.

      <h3>Meal Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Maybe you’re the kind of person that cooks dinner on a whim. If you’re not, you can use the Meal-Planning page. This allows you to save up to a week’s worth of recipes for your upcoming dinners while automatically compiling a shopping list you can print and take with you to the grocery store. All you have to do is use the recipe generator and look for meals you like. When you find something you want to make, just select the Calendar icon and pick which day you want to plan it for. If you change your mind, it’s as easy as clicking the Remove button or dragging it to a different day. Feel free to skip a day if you need to, there’s no minimum number of recipes. Just plan for what you want to eat. When you’re done, simply push Print Shopping List to get a physical compilation of all the ingredients you’re going to need for the week on one sheet of paper, quantities included.
